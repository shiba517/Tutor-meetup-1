# **USER EXPERIENCE (UX)**

## **Aim of the website**
The city council has given me the task to design and create a website for a football tournament for the local. The website must attract people to particpate as a form of celebration and a way to build the community spirit back up after the recent extra long lockdown.

## **The 5 Planes**
### **Strategy**
This website will be targeted at those that used to play football regularly pre lockdown. This will mainly consist of males aged between the late teens to mid-30s. 

By creating a website, I will be able to help encourage the locals to play competitive football again. This will be done mainly by focusing
* on informing the user how, where and when the tournament will be played
* engaging content and imagery
* simple registration form

This website will be a business to consumer(B2C) website meaning 
* I really shouldn't bombared or be too discrete of any information
* fairly safe ot assume the users will have atleast a good level of experience with using websites across all platforms
* simplicity and attractiveness would be vital as young people are constantly exposed to good looking websites and therfore can be put off easily from a dull looking website.

#### **User stories**
##### Main user story:
As someone that used to love playing football prior to the lockdown, I want to enter a competitve tournament of like minded people so I can feel normal again due to the lockdown shutting all sports activities down for so long

##### Visiting goals for first timers:
As a first time viewr, I want to be able to find out more about the tournament in terms of where it will be played, how it'll will be runned and when it will be held etc.

I want to see testimonials and/or pictures of all or either the locations, previous organised tournaments and testimonials so i can decide whether it'll be worth my time and help encourage possible team mates to participate. 

##### Returning goals for previous visitors:
I want to be able to register my team and contact the organisers regarding any information I might have. I will also want to be able to register my team easily and recieve a quick responce so I and my team members can prepare for the tournament.

##### Frequent goals for active viewers
As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to check find out the details regarding the tournament again which will be useful in situations where I want to show others of the tournament, go back on information that I didn't remember and the location of the venue (especially on the day when travelling).

### **Scope**
There are many features I can include to my website. Due to my limited skillset for now, I will have to make do with selecting what I can do and what is relevent for the manner of the event.




I will finally include the folllowing features
#### Header/Home page
* Must be eye catching as it is the first page the user will see
* It should include navigation to other pages/sections of the website so they can easily navigate to where they want to be
* It shoudl create excitement and encourage the user to explore the website

#### How it works
* Inform the user how the tournament will be runned
* Quick concise context so the user doesn't feel like their reading a piece of 'boring' information. This will also help add to the the excitement as the user will feel 'nudged' to the next section of the website
* An image(s) will help build a 'fun' element to the text

#### Gallery
* including images of previous tournaments will give the user a glimse of this upcoming tournament
* By having it right before the registration page, it really should be the last point to finally get them to say 'yes' if they wasn't too sure before.

#### Registration
* Having a simple pitch looking registration form will remove any 'dragging' feeling of what usual forms give off. This is especially for the users from the lower end of the targeted age group.

#### Footer/About us page
* Should include a short story(a paragraph or two) of the organisers. This will create a closer bond to the users as they will not feel like they're just entering a venue and kicking a ball for the day; They will be part of an event with 'value' and human faces.
* It will also include important contact information so they can get in touch of any questions they have regarding the tournament
* A link to the organisers social media page will be helpful as those platforms can help engage with the people and help spread the word.

### **Structure**
The physical structure of website should be of linnear look throughout all platforms which will help create a story like feel to it. The user will have been caught with their attention from the home page, then be informed and excited when done reading the 'how it works' section, a gallery to help nudge them to join if they are having any doubts and finally a registratin page to get them sign up and attend. 

A nav bar that stays on top will help the user on from their first visit and especially from their second and onwards visit as they can easily move to the pages they want for whatever reasons such as showing their friend the images from the gallery, or if they are now certain they want to join, they can easily click on the regittraion link etc. A nested list will be avoided on the phone as there isnt too many sections and it will add a 'formal' look to website.

It'll be mainly of a green and some yellow of retor gadget like tone which will be in place from the header section to the footer with the shades changing for clear separation of sections. The typography will be IBM Plex Mono (from googleFonts) which will suit the retro gadget theme of the website.

I will take inspiration from the following images
